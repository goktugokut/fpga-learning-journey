# Basics – Fundamental VHDL Designs

## Overview
This folder contains basic VHDL designs that introduce fundamental digital logic
and hardware description concepts.

Each project focuses on clarity, synthesizability, and correct simulation behavior.

- Combinational logic
- Simple sequential elements
- Introduction to testbenches

---

## Design Goals
- Understand VHDL syntax and structure
- Write readable and maintainable code
- Learn correct use of signals and processes
- Build a solid foundation for more complex designs
